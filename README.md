## 💳 Payments (Paystack)

### Required environment variables

Create or update your `.env` with:

```bash
# Backend / server
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_or_test_...
PAYSTACK_CURRENCY=NGN
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Frontend
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Local testing

1. No SDK required; the server calls Paystack REST API.
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server and frontend together:
```bash
npm run start:all
```

3. Navigate to `Upgrade` page and select a plan; you should be redirected to Paystack Checkout.

> Callback URL: `${FRONTEND_URL}/dashboard?upgrade=success`

Use Paystack test cards from their docs during testing.

### Deploying on Vercel

1. Add Environment Variables in Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables:
   - `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`
   - `PAYSTACK_CURRENCY` (e.g., `NGN`)
   - `FRONTEND_URL` (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
   - All Firebase configuration variables

2. Serverless endpoint
   - The app exposes a serverless function at `/api/payments/init` (`src/pages/api/payments/init.ts`).
   - On Vercel, the frontend can call this same-origin path without CORS.

3. Frontend config
   - Ensure frontend calls `/api/payments/init` without hardcoding a localhost base URL in production.
   - If you use `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, leave it empty in production so requests go same-origin.

4. Test in production
   - Open your deployed `/upgrade` page and try Pro/Premium. You should be redirected to Paystack.

## 🔑 Key Features Explained

### Daily Streak System

The daily streak tracks consecutive days where at least one meal has been logged. The system:
- Counts backwards from today
- Continues the streak even if today has no meals yet (allows logging later)
- Breaks the streak when a past day with no meals is found
- Updates automatically when meals are logged

### Meal Tracking

- Meals are stored in Firebase Firestore
- Each meal includes: name, type, calories, protein, carbs, fat, date, and time
- Meals can be filtered by type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
- Daily totals are calculated automatically

### Progress Analytics

- Tracks calories consumed over time
- Visualizes weight changes
- Calculates consistency metrics
- Supports multiple time ranges (7, 30, 90 days, all time)
